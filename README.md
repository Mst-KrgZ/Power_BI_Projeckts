## 🚀 How to Use
1. Download and install [Power BI Desktop](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/desktop/).  
2. Open the `.pbix` file of the project you want to explore.  
3. If the project includes datasets, place them in the `data/` folder.  
4. Update dataset paths if needed: **Home → Transform Data → Data Source Settings**.  
5. Refresh the data to load the visuals.

## 📝 Notes
- `.pbix` files can be large, so they should be tracked with **Git LFS**.  
- Some datasets are excluded for privacy reasons.  
- Each project folder includes a dedicated `README.md` with details, screenshots, and (if available) a link to the published version on Power BI Service.
